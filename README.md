## Lessons Learned

This project was purposed to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Parit Raja, Batu Pahat, Johor. This project is not easy enough to complete as I am challenge myself to build a system with complex data operation and business process. Using a multi-tier architecture or distributed services like front-end, back-end, databases and APIs, I can improve myself to be a system design and architecture expert. I am ready and open to face any challenges related to designing and architecturing the whole system.
